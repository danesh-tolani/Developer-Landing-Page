# Project 9

Hi, My name is **Danesh Tolani** and I have completed the 9th Project of the iNeuron Full Stack Course.

The most challenging things were:

- Writing html for long page and managing the DIVs and containers.
- Aligning the icons and images properly.

It took me **4 Hours** to complete this project
